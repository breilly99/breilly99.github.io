      <h2>About Me</h2>

        <h3>Connecticut</h3>

        <p>I grew up in Manchester, Connecticut, a small town outside of Hartford. I lived there for 14 years before moving.</p>

        <p>I always grew up playing sports. Since I was three, I played baseball, basketball, and swam as well. Sports have always been a huge part of my life.</p>

        <p>I am a big Boston sports fan, whether it is the Patriots, Red Sox, Celtics or Bruins, I grew up loving Boston sports.</p>

        <p>With my dad, we would often make the trip from Manchester to Boston to go to games, only adding to my love of sports more.</p>

        <p>Going to games, or watching them on television or listening on radio, made me start to think how could I stay in sports.</p>

        <p>When I was 14, my dad's job made my family move from Manchester to Charlotte, North Carolina, saying goodbye to all my friends and family in the Northeast.</p>

        <h3>Charlotte</h3>

        <p>After moving to Charlotte, I continued to play sports and also started playing football in high school. At my new school, Charlotte Latin, they offered a journalism class, and this is where I got my start.</p>

        <p>My school offered a journalism class that I took for three years, setting the ground floor for what my future would hold. I would make packages, write stories, and cover games for my class.</p>

        <p>While in high school, I wanted to go to a school that had a strong journalism program. I applied only to schools that would give me an opportunity to broadcast, one of those being the University of Miami.</p>

        <p>After taking my tour, I knew that Miami was the place I wanted to be after hearing about UMTV and WVUM 90.5FM, and the student broadcasting opportunities that were available.</p>

        <h3>The University of Miami</h3>

        <p>When I came to the University of Miami, I immediatley joined UMTV and WVUM 90.5FM my freshman year. I started off as an analyst on UMTV and then a broadcaster on smaller games for WVUM.</p>

        <p>In my second semester, I started to make a jump at both places. I was named an anchor for UMTV's SportsDesk as a freshman and was able to go on Women's Basketball road trips.</p>

        <p>I ended up calling over 30 games as a freshman for WVUM, setting myself up to be named Sports Director as a sophomore, and I have held the position for the past two and a half years.</p>

        <p>Once I took over as Sports Director, I took over a staff of over 20 people, working closely with Miami Athletics and scheduling all broadcasts for each week.</p>

        <p>WVUM has taken me places I could have never imagined, including stadiums such as Cameron Indoor Stadium, the Carrier Dome, and Dean Smith Arena.</p>

        <p>Also, this past semester, I was able to travel for the Men's and Women's NCAA Tournaments, broadcasting solo on WVUM 90.5FM.</p>

        <p>In total, I have broadcasted over 150 games during my time at Miami, taking up a huge portion of my time in college, but one that I am forever grateful for.</p>

        <h3>The Future</h3>

        <p>This upcoming summer, I will be broadcasting for the Cowlitz Black Bears of the West Coast League.</p>

        <p>I was trying to enter Minor League Baseball this summer, but with start dates not lining up with my graduation, I decided to go back to a collegiate summer league to gain more experience.</p>

        <p>I am actively looking for play-by-play jobs at colleges for the fall and winter hoping to become the voice of a university.</p>
